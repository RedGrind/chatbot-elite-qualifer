## Background
This is my qualifier project for the Code2College Elite 101 course. I chose the third option of "chatbot".
## Install
This system uses c++. 
## Usage
This systems reacts based on the sentence stem that has been inputted by the user. 

If the user enters something that is not in the format of a set stem, the bot will ask the user to re-enter their message.

## Test Plan

To test the project:

1.  Run the test
2.  Check the results
3.  Ask for user input
